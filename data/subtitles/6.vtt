00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:08.029
So, uh, one of the uh, well the brightest
gamma ray line on the sky, uh, is created

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.590
when electrons and positrons annihilate.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.639
And that makes a five and eleven kilo-electron
volt line.

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:20.720
So these units, by the way an electron volt
is simply the energy that an electron has

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.230
when it moves across a potential of one volt.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.910
So if you have a nine volt battery, an electron
in that battery goes around a circuit, it

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.490
had nine electron volts.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:29.490
Okay.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.190
So, uh, these are five hundred and eleven
thousand electron volts, so they're rather

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.260
higher energy.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.379
And that's usually the lowest energy thing
we would refer to as a gamma ray, and then

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:42.050
they go up many orders of magnitude above
that.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.810
They also get created by radioactive elements
decaying.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.410
To astronomers, aluminum twenty-six is a very
interesting element.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.039
Maybe most of you don't worry about aluminum
twenty-six every day, but it gets created

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.559
in supernovae.

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.280
Um, so, here are two maps, this is a map of
the five eleven kv line.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.379
Kv lines.

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.800
So this is actually positrons annihilating
in our galaxy, full sky map.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.520
You see there are a lot of positrons in the
center of the galaxy and not much elsewhere,

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.280
and that's interesting we still don't actually
know where these come from.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.280
Uh, they've been observed for over thirty
years, we don't know what's going on.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.470
Uh, here's another one, this one we do know
what's going on, this is the aluminum twenty-six

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.410
line if you tune your gamma ray telescope
to one point eight million electron volts

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.700
you see this line for aluminum, and that's
very informative, because, uh, star blows

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.030
up and creates aluminum twenty-six, and then
it has a half-life of about a million years,

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.780
so within a million years, you see this gamma
ray line, and by making a map of this, we're

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.920
really mapping where the supernovae in the
galaxy are, on a very large scale, and of

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.310
course this is the galactic plane, it looks
like that because we live in the Milky Way

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.680
and you're in the disk galaxy, so when you
look at it you see this.
